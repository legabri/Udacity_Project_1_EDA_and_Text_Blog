# Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Udacity

## Here is a brief description of the projects I have done.


## Questions<br>
## Quebec is divided into 17 administrative regions.<br>
## The questions I intend to answer are:<br>
## 1) 5 regions with more births in each period<br>
## 2) 3 regions with fewer births in each period<br>
## 3) Regions and periods where mortality at birth was highest<br>
## 4) Regions and periods where mortality at birth was lower<br>
## 5) Regions and periods where there were more births with caesarean section<br>
## 6) Regions and periods where there were fewer births with caesarean section<br>
## 7) Overview of the province<br>
## 8) Bonus: 2020â€“2021 birth prediction based on the variation of the last two periods<br>


## Project 1 - Write A Data Science Blog Post

## Descriptive analysis answering at least 3 questions.<br>
## Submit the code on github.<br>
## Write a blogpost telling the experience<br>


## This project was done on a jupyter notebook.<br>
## To be reproduced you will need<br>
## -Python 3<br>
## -Numpy<br>
