## Project Motivation

Hello my name is Gabriel, this post is part of project 1 for the Udacity Nano Degree Data Scientist Diploma.<br>
I am Brazilian but I have lived in Canada for a few years, more specifically in the province of Quebec.<br>
And my daughter was born in 2018<br>

### Introduction
Quebec is the second largest province in Canada in number of inhabitants and French is spoken here.<br>
Montreal is the second largest French-speaking city in the world, just behind Paris in France.<br>
I decided to analyze the birth data from April 2013 until March 2020 (all available in donneesquebec.ca).<br>
This is an interesting question for me, as I have been a father for just over 2 years and the increase and maintenance of the number of births is essential for a place to continue to exist and be able to pay the retirement of the elderly.

### The questions I intend to answer are:<br>

### 1) 5 regions with more births in each period<br>
### 2) 3 regions with fewer births in each period<br>
### 3) Regions and periods where mortality at birth was highest<br>
### 4) Regions and periods where mortality at birth was lower<br>
### 5) Regions and periods where there were more births with caesarean section<br>
### 6) Regions and periods where there were fewer births with caesarean section<br>
### 7) Overview of the province<br>
### 8) Bonus: 2020â€“2021 birth prediction based on the variation of the last two periods<br>


## File Descriptions

The notebook 'udacity_project_1.ipynb' strives to answer some chosen question using simple exploratory data analysis, and descriptive statistics, (the aim is to avoid using any i

The data folder contains 7 files:

One file for each year of birth data by region of the province.

### The files needed for this analysis are in this directory and can also be downloaded at www.donneesquebec.ca<br>

## Results

Unfortunately, in the majority of the analyzed periods, the birth rate decreases.<br>
But luckily in the last 3 periods we have timid growth.<br>
I already think about private retirement alternatives for my last days.<br>
The government could facilitate the immigration of couples with children to minimize the problem.<br>
